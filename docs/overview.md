## Database 

- Database bascically acts like a compiler for a specialized syntax(SQL) and interfaces with the OS.
- So we have some familiar stages like :
  - Tokenizer 
  - Parser 
  - Code Generator 
- Other Phases (backend) that are very DB centric:
  - Virtual Machine 
  - B-Tree
  - Pager 
  - OS Interface

- A query goes through chain of components in order to retrieve or modify the data. Frontend consists of :
  - Tokenizer 
  - Parser 
  - Code Generator 

- Input to the front-end is a SQL query, the output is sqlite vm bytecode.

- Backend consists of :
  - Virtual Machine 
    - Takes bytecode generated by the front=end as instructions. It can then perform operations on one or more tables or indexes, each of which is stored in a data structure called a B-Tree.
  - B-Tree
    - Consists of many nodes. Each node is 1 page in length. B-Tree can retrieve a page from disk or save it back to disk by issuing commands to the pager.
  - Pager 
    - Receives commands to read or write pages of data. It is responsible for reading/writing at appropriate offsets in database files. It will also keeps a cache of recently-accessed pages in memory , and determines when those pages needs to be written back to disk.
  - OS Interface 
    - Layer that differes depending on which OS sqlite is compiled for.
